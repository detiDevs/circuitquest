    "description": "An RS-Flipflop stores 1-Bit by storing the last value of the input and returning it on the next clock cycle. \nS (Set) forces the output to 1, R (Reset) forces it to **0`.\nIf both inputs are 0, the circuit keeps its previous value due to feedback.\nThis is the fundamental memory element showing how state is preserved.",

    "objectives": [
        "Build an RS flip-flop using two NOR gates."," Ensure that:"," \nS = 1 → Q = 1 ","\nR = 1 → Q = 0 ","\nS = 0 and R = 0 → Q keeps its old value ","\nNote: S = 1 and R = 1 is invalid (undefined state)"
